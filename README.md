Hello! My name is Amit Kulkarni and I'm an undergrad CS major at Georgia Tech. 

Want to keep this intro short so feel free to browse my repositories to see the projects I've worked on. For the projects completed during a hackathon, you can click on the devpost link to see more information about them. 

Otherwise, feel free to connect with me on linkedin or contact me via email to learn more about me!
