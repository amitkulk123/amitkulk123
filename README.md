Hello! My name is Amit Kulkarni and I'm an undergrad CS major at Georgia Tech. 

Feel free to browse through my repositories to see the projects I've worked on. For the hackathon projects,  click on the devpost link in the project's README.md file to view more information about them and the competition they were submitted for.
